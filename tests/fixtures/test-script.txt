Welcome to a journey through time that stretches far beyond the story of Adam as the very first human. Our tale begins long before the Garden of Eden, in the dusty scrolls and clay tablets of ancient civilizations. In those early days, storytellers recorded their own versions of how people came to be, and they painted a picture far richer and more complex than a single creation event.

Imagine ancient Sumer, where scribes etched the Enuma Elish onto clay tablets around two thousand years before our era. In that Babylonian creation epic, the great god Marduk fashions humankind from the blood of a defeated god, Kingu, after a cosmic battle. Humanity's birth in this story is an act of sacrifice by divine beings and a way to relieve the gods of labor. This narrative shows that people emerged out of divine conflict and transformation, not simply out of dust in a garden. The Enuma Elish unfolds across seven tablets, with Tablet IV offering the clearest account of this human creation process.

Travel westward to ancient Egypt, where the Memphite theology attributed the birth of humans to the god Ptah. In the Shabaka Stone inscription, Ptah conceives the world in his heart and speaks it into existence. Every creature, every person, comes forth from his divine utterance. This idea of thought and speech crafting life long predates any reference to Adam. It speaks to a worldview where creation is an ongoing song, not a one-off event. Egyptian priests relied on these teachings as early as the third millennium BCE.
