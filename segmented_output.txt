When we turn to the Hebrew Bible

we discover hints that Adam might not be the sole origin of humanity.

In Genesis Chapter One, verses twenty-six and twenty-seven, the text speaks of

“Let us make humankind in our image,” suggesting a divine council at work.

Then, in Chapter Two, verse seven, a distinct narrative presents

Adam being formed from dust and granted life by God’s breath.

These two creation accounts woven side by side suggest different traditions and perhaps

different populations of early humans being acknowledged by the ancient editors or storytellers.
