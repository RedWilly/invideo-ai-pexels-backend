Welcome to a journey through time that stretches far beyond the story of Adam as the very first human. Our tale begins long before the Garden of Eden, in the dusty scrolls and clay tablets of ancient civilizations. In those early days, storytellers recorded their own versions of how people came to be, and they painted a picture far richer and more complex than a single creation event.

Imagine ancient Sumer, where scribes etched the Enuma Elish onto clay tablets around two thousand years before our era. In that Babylonian creation epic, the great god Marduk fashions humankind from the blood of a defeated god, Kingu, after a cosmic battle.
